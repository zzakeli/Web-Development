    <h4>Lyrics</h4>
    <pre>
        like a wildflower
        so many colors but not enough to picture your smile
        make it never fade it can make my day

        just wait oh oh

        I can be your love your sunlight
        so keep your eyes on me, on me

        dance to the daisies or any flower
        or stand there and I can't tell you apart
        I'll be rain for you even on sunny days
        so paint my world with your colors

        let's lie in the sun, for hours and hours
        til the day goes by and though

        we might not be forever, just hold my hand anyways
        let's bloom in ways where we can touch the stars
        even though they're far
        
        but if you wanna stay then I'll stay with you

        dance to the daisies or any flower
        or stand there and I can't tell you apart
        I'll be rain for you even on sunny days
        so paint my world with your colors
    </pre>
